# Visualizer of a GitHub project
This project shows you visual representation of (theoretically) any project located on github.com in the form of graph.
You can move and zoom your visualization, hover on commit and see information about it. Also you can see statistics of any branch of loaded project.

Here is some repositories to test:
- https://github.com/davidomarf/lastfm
- https://github.com/drop-ice/dear-github-2.0
- https://github.com/sdmg15/Best-websites-a-programmer-should-visit
- https://github.com/VkOpt/VkOpt

## Known issues:
- **CRITICAL** At the moment the visualiser doesn't work properly with commits that have no parent. IF YOUR PROJECT HAS ONES DON'T VISUALIZE IT. Else the visualizer will enter an endless loop.
- Tooltip position scale doesn't work correctly when resizing the window after visualization is done.

Work in progress...
